# gdSnake

gdSnake is a small game used to learn Godot. I'm gonna try to finish it in just one weeken from this first commit. 

The project runs in **Godot 3**.

### Features

Basic snake game in 2d, with almost not graphics:

- Tiles maps
- Snake controlled by the user
- Apple that appears randomly
- Collisions

### How to play

Move the snake with the arrows (you must click over the game first).
You can play the game [here](https://oscaralonsob.github.io/gdGames/)
